/*
    In this module, a "polynomial" is represented by an array of coefficients,
    where each term's degree is determined by its index in the array. The last
    item of such an array represents a constant term (i.e. with x to a degree
    of zero), the second-to-last item represents a term with x raised to one,
    etc. For example:

        [ 1 ] means "1"
        [ 1, 0 ] means "x"
        [ 1, 0, 0 ] means "x^2"
        [ 5, 7, 1, 11 ] means "5x^3 + 7x^2 + x + 11"
        [ 1, 0, 8, 0 ]  means "x^3 + 8x"
